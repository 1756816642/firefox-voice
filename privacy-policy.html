<p>When Mozilla (that’s us) receives information from you, our <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> describes how we handle that information. In particular, you should know the following about Firefox Voice:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Voice Recordings.</strong> When you choose to use Firefox Voice, your voice recordings are sent to Mozilla and Google’s Cloud Speech service for processing to provide you with suggested text. We do not keep the recordings or the transcripts of the recordings unless we specifically request it and you specifically consent.</li>
<li><strong>Interaction Data.</strong> Mozilla receives metrics information including the number of voice samples recorded, session length and outcome, results provided by Firefox Voice, and whether those results are modified or selected.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback.</strong> Firefox Voice is an experimental product. We may reach out to you at the email you provided to ask for feedback about Firefox Voice.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Data.</strong> Mozilla receives technical data from Firefox Voice related to performance of the feature, such as browser type and time needed to process submitted recordings.</li>
</ul>
